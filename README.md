# DDAB-Robot

Arduino code for our robot at Fall 2018 PSU Robotics' competition. Included is the code to control two motors, three ultrasonic sensors, and the motor controller itself.

Unfortunately, the final iteration of our code is unfortunately lost, though we did manage to create an unreliable yet working algorithm in the end.
